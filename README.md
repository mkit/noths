## Test for NOTHS checkout

Notes.

1. The ``Main`` class has the ``main`` method that test the data in the assignment.
2. I refrained myself from using 3rd party libraries (e.g. Guava, Apache Commons).
3. There is no persistence. Everything is in memory.
4. The ``Checkout`` class has synchronised methods but in general the assumption I made is single-threaded execution.
